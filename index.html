  <h2>What are assistive mobility devices? </h2>


<p>Technology for seniors is a wide area of appliances designed for the elderly generations- people 65 and above. These tools allow this demographic of people to enjoy their everyday life, in place with the unfortunate decrease in their physical capabilities. And a major area that technology for seniors caters to is movement. Whether that be designing infrastructure with accessibility standards to allow easier movement, or usable mobility devices such as canes and or rollators- devices that may be fundamental to a person's activities of daily living. And as time goes forward these devices are becoming more efficient and more accessible to people with mobility impairments such as cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, arthritis and more. (Hou et al., 2024).​</p>

<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>

<p>This has been a continuously relevant topic in our society despite how unexamined it is in our mainstream discussions, despite how we will all one day be affected by this topic as we grow older. Over the past decades, the problem of aging has gained significant popularity as the number of old people has been growing substantially, relative to the whole world’s population. According to some estimations one third of the urban citizens will be over 65 years old in the next ten years (Fatima K. et al.. 2020). It is commonly known that seniors are one of the most susceptible classes of any society in terms of health and mobility problems. As time goes by, human body’s abilities become more limited in daily activities, which means that a middle-aged person faces more and more difficulties in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. According to (Liu, Q., et al. 2020), studies emphasized how important it is for seniors to be involved in different types of physical activities. Special attention is needed in relation to the accessibility and mobility for elders as it is a vital condition for their everyday routine. In this case, assistive mobility devices serve as essential means of helping old people overcome the difficulties, they encounter due to the aging of the body. Additionally, to this problem, elderly are suffering from problems associated with their lack of independency in terms of daily life. Assistive devices for the elderly play a crucial role in maintaining their independence and improving their quality of life by addressing mobility limitations and enabling them to engage in daily activities, moving around their environments, with greater ease and confidence.​​</p>

<h2>Why we've researched this. </h2>

<p>We have chosen to research into this topic as the prevalence of mobility related disabilities plague our world. Around 20.5 million adults in the United States report living with a mobility-related disability, and over 89.2% of people with disabilities live in inaccessible housing. More specifically, over 50% of homeowners with disabilities live in inaccessible housing. Grieman, L. (2022).  The issue worsens when the fact that the global population is aging at an alarming rate, the proportion of individuals with sensory disabilities is expected to rise by 2050. This has been associated with reduced mobility, hospitalization, disability, diseases, and deaths. (Gupta, P. 2024). Additionally, the accessibility and availability in lower-income countries makes the situation worse. The lack of established models, high delivery costs, and financially strained countries barely provide support services for prosthetics. (C.A. Donnelley 2021). Because of all these alarming and distressing statistics of those that are suffering, we have decided to look into the lives of seniors and how their movement is supported by their technology and contribute to their everyday wellbeing. In this document, we look at the opportunities that arise with the technology, what the technology is capable of, the risks that come with it, and our conclusions and recommendations for the future of elderly mobility technologies.</p>
