  <h2>Assistance Devices for Elderly Mobility</h2>


<p>Technology for seniors is a wide area of instruments that are specifically designed to be used by the elderly generations- people 65 and above. These tools allow this demographic of people to enjoy their everyday life to their full extent, in place with the unfortunate decrease in their mental or physical capabilities. ​

  ​
  
  And a major area that technology for seniors caters to is movement. Whether that be designing infrastructure with accessibility standards to allow easier movement, or usable mobility devices such as canes and or rollators- devices that may be fundamental to a person's activities of daily living. And as time goes forward these devices are becoming more efficient and more accessible to people with mobility impairments such as cerebral palsy (Hou et al., 2024).</p>
<p>The site is not particularly well presented, but as the site uses HTML and has been styled with CSS it can be regarded as a <em>"minimum viable product"</em> for the purposes of this project&hellip;
It has some default links, which you can take as a start for your site structure.  The <em>Process Support </em>Links provides guidance which will be needed for presenting your final project. </p>
