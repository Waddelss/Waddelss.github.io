  <h2>What can we conclude from this? </h2>


<p>Looking into the choices we have for this technology, we find that there is a noticeable contrast between the typical mobility devices seniors use (canes, rollators, wheelchairs, and more) and the more advanced versions of these tools that are becoming available in today’s modern age. They differ greatly in terms of the features they are capable of but also the prices of each. For example, advanced mobility devices that have built in sensors or monitoring devices like the “Wifi Controlled Wheelchair” we discussed in the opportunities section that has the potential to support senior independence, safety, reliability, and overall wellbeing. However, in exchange it would tend to be more expensive as the materials and skill to build it would be significantly more. These advanced technologies also face the problem of complexity creep, which is a phenomenon where the more functionalities a system has, the more difficult it is for people to use it.  In this context, seniors who are technologically illiterate will evidently have a harder time utilising these devices. The Wifi Controlled Wheelchair is designed around the input from an app on a mobile phone. To set this up would require the installation of the app, connecting it to the wheelchair, and learning the way around the app’s interface. While the elderly demographic is becoming more technologically savvy due to the large presence of digital devices today, the setup for the Wifi Controlled Wheelchair and furthermore other advanced devices similar to it, may be too complicated for the average senior to incorporate into their life. Because of this, we need to start focusing on how we can transition these users into being more comfortable with these devices, such as having a readily accessible user support once they purchase the device as well as for the foreseeable future if they want to ask any questions.​</p>

<p>With all these opportunities considered, we can confidently see how the current and future state of mobility technology for seniors is constantly innovating to contribute to the everyday lives of senior citizens, but also our greater society. This can be seen in how these devices that collect data of the user can decrease the load of work on caregivers who take care of them, as they will need less time actively looking over their person. This makes it so the caregivers can take more time tending to critical issues, or just servicing more tailored care to seniors. And while this reducing es the burden on caregivers, the mobility technology also relieves the burden on the users themselves by allowing the use of movement and various mechanics of their devices more accessible to this demographic by implementing features for multiple input for control, such as the wheelchair using voice-control, or the wifi-controlled-wheelchair that is able to be easily operated through a mobile phone. These opportunities of easier accessibility means that movement devices that may be important for elderly people to live their normal life, can be easily used and implemented into their lifestyle, rather than feeling like it’s an obstacle they need to juggle with in order to be happy. These devices fosters an inclusive society by allowing the senior demographic to have more independence and agency that can especially benefit their mental health as depression in elderly people is often been partly a product of the lack of movement, such as seen in a study from Lampinen (Lampinen, P. 2003).</p>  

<p>Less physical accidents coincide with the escalating implementation of monitoring capabilities in tools such as canes or rollators: it is no question that monitoring devices can prevent future accidents from occurring. However, a tradeoff is the risk of a person’s general right to privacy. This is due to how many devices that implement these features also tend to continuously track the user’s position and or other factors about the user around the clock. Knowing how much information about them is being tracked can negatively affect the user’s mental wellbeing. This has been shown in a study by Essén (Essén, A. 2008) where, a group of 17 seniors were given monitoring device on their wrist to track a variety of data such as movement or sleeping patterns, one of the participates asked to withdraw from the research as they felt it was ‘constraining’. While this study did not directly relate to mobility devices, the wrist monitoring device used in the study is quite similar to the monitoring abilities of mobility tools that we’ve been discussing. This further provides evidence to consider data monitoring common in mobility tools from a humanistic perspective as some people may not be comfortable with these new capabilities and therefore should be allowed to refuse or find an alternative.</p>
