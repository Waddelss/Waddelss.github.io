  <h2>What are the choices we have with this technology? </h2>


  <p><b>Mobility devices</b><br>

    When it comes to elderly that need assistive mobility technology, there is a myriad of choices that are available currently which caters towards those with degrading motor control. The primary choice for elderly are traditional aids such as manual wheelchairs, walkers, and canes which are assistive mobility technologies that provide support and stability for the elderly (Yusif et al., 2016).  These choices are simple, cost-effective and reliable but lack in additional features which would enhance the elderly with their independence and safety, therefore only providing a limited solution to the mobility issues faced by seniors.

    <p><b>Powered Mobility Devices</b><br>
      Naturally the next choice would be powered mobility devices which are electronically enhanced mobility devices which provide improved functionality, support, and independence for the elderly. Powered mobility devices that are commonly available are powered wheelchairs and mobility scooters.
      </p>

<p>Powered wheelchairs typically feature a chargeable battery that powers the wheelchair motor, with controls that can be operated via different parts of the body such as hand, foot, or mouth depending on the model which controls the direction of the powered wheelchair or change the elevation of the seating that helps allows the user to reach higher places (Sehgal et al., 2021). This allows the elderly to have control of their movement without the need of a caregiver, enhancing their independence and quality of life.</p>

<p>The mobility scooters are another powered mobility device that is available to the elderly. This is an alternative choice to elderly and is recommended for those who are mobile enough to travel short distances but need it for longer distances and have the upper body strength to operate the handlebar. This powered mobility device is battery operated that usually have between three to five wheels that is steered via a handlebar (Thoreau, 2015). Despite the benefits that these powered mobility devices provide, these devices come at a higher cost which can reduces the accessibility for some users. Additionally, maintenance and repair costs can be significant, potentially adding to the financial burden on the elderly or their caregivers.</p>


<p><b>Smart Mobility devices</b><br>
  With the implementation of smart features such as GPS, obstacle avoidance systems and voice control. Another choice would be smart canes and walker which can support the elderly and provide safety by detecting obstacles in the way using a camera or sensors. These devices help the elderly with limited mobility to navigate towards the right direction through features like haptic feedback or voice guidance (Yan et al., 2019). The integration of these technologies allows the elderly to move around with greater confidence and security, minimizing the risk of falls or accidents.

  <p>Another smart mobility device would be a smart wheelchair can particularly help elderly with severe mobility degradation. Through the use of voice control which allows voice commands to be used to navigate the smart wheelchair helping them be less dependent on caregivers (Simpson, 2005). These devices can also be equipped with features like automated braking systems, advanced navigation assistance, and even health monitoring tools that track vital signs, enhancing the overall safety and well-being of the user.</p>

  <p>However, these smart mobility devices also require a higher budget and a certain level of technological literacy is required to operate these devices effectively which reduces the accessibility for some elderly individuals who aren’t familiar with such technologies.</p>
