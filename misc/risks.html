  <h2>What are the risks of this technology?</h2>

<p>Mobility technology for seniors encompasses a wide range of assistive devices and innovations designed to aid elderly individuals in their daily tasks, monitor their health, and provide companionship. As the global population ages, the demand for smart and robotic technologies has surged, aiming to address the challenges associated with aging. However, despite their potential benefits, these technologies also pose significant risks that need careful consideration.
  Seniors are a particularly vulnerable demographic, often facing numerous health and mobility issues. Mobility technology, including devices like walkers, wheelchairs, robotic assistants, and health monitoring systems, can substantially improve their quality of life. However, these benefits can be overshadowed by potential dangers, especially when the technology is designed with a primary focus on the illness rather than the individual. This approach aligns with a medical model of care that often overlooks the psychosocial aspects of aging (Dahl et al., 2013).
  One major risk associated with mobility technology is the complexity and difficulty of use. Many elderly individuals find modern devices challenging to operate due to unfamiliarity, cognitive impairments, or poorly designed interfaces. This can lead to frustration, misuse, or complete abandonment of the technology. Moreover, lack of customization to cater to specific personal needs further deters seniors from adopting these devices.
  </p>

  <p>Cost is another significant barrier. High acquisition and maintenance expenses make these technologies unaffordable for many lower-income seniors. Even for those who can afford the initial purchase, ongoing costs for service, updates, and repairs can become a financial burden. This economic strain can prevent seniors from accessing potentially life-enhancing technologies. Additionally, limited financial literacy among some seniors can exacerbate these issues, as they might not fully understand the long-term costs associated with owning and maintaining such devices.</p>


  <p>Privacy and security concerns are also paramount. Assistive devices often require the collection of sensitive personal and health data, making elderly users attractive targets for cyberattacks and fraud (Essén, 2008). The elderly are particularly wary of sharing their private information, fearing it may be misused. Continuous monitoring can feel intrusive, raising ethical questions about the extent of surveillance and the right to privacy. This issue is compounded by the fact that many seniors may not be familiar with digital security practices, leaving them even more vulnerable to exploitation.</p>

<p>Over-reliance on mobility technology presents another serious risk. Dependence on these devices can lead to physical and cognitive decline. When seniors rely heavily on technology to perform daily tasks, they may engage in less physical activity and social interaction, which are crucial for maintaining health and mental well-being (Noori et al., 2019). Furthermore, in cases of malfunction or technical errors, the absence of immediate human assistance can result in dangerous situations, potentially endangering lives.</p>

<p>Social isolation is another unintended consequence of assistive technologies. While these devices can provide essential support, they may also reduce the need for human interaction. When seniors can meet all their needs through technology, they might not seek help from others, leading to feelings of loneliness and abandonment. This lack of social engagement can exacerbate mental health issues, such as depression and anxiety (Noori et al., 2019). The role of human touch and real-life interaction is irreplaceable for emotional and psychological health, and technology, despite its advancements, cannot fully substitute these vital human connections.
  Moreover, there is the issue of adaptability. As technology advances rapidly, the rate of change can outpace seniors’ ability to keep up. This can result in a perpetual learning curve that many older adults find overwhelming. Training programs and support systems are often insufficient, leading to underutilization of the available technology. Efforts must be made to ensure that seniors are not left behind in the digital divide, emphasizing the importance of education and ongoing support.
