  <h2>What opportunities do we have from this mobility technology?​ </h2>

<p>Mobility devices for the elderly population have taken a significant step forward, becoming more efficient and technologically advanced, showcasing numerous opportunities to improve their quality of life. Recent prototypes such as the "Voice-Controlled Wheelchair," which uses voice recognition, motors, and sensors to operate, offer multifunctional smart solutions that recognize user commands and transmit them to an Arduino system, addressing the need for constant caretaker presence (S.M Omair, 2023). Similarly, the "Wi-Fi Controlled Wheelchair," which supports remote motion control by a dedicated application, has been successful. (W.M Batayneh et al., 2018). These innovations enhance independence, safety, and accessibility for elderly users, while the broader field of mobility technology, including smart walkers and mobility apps, further supports ease of use with simplified interfaces. Additionally, community transport services and the integration of diagnosing patients with telecommunication technology further increase social engagement and continuous healthcare access, respectively. Economically, these advancements create job opportunities in various sectors and reduce the constant assistance of caregivers, promoting a supportive and inclusive society for the elderly.​  </p>

<p>The development of an improved cane handle using an analytical hierarchy method presents significant opportunities for enhancing elderly mobility technology. By designing a cane handle that primarily focuses on stability and comfort. By doing this, it can substantially improve the quality of life for elderly users. This advancement not only addresses the issue of improper cane use but also encourages consistent use, thereby reducing the high risk of falls and injuries among the elderly population. Furthermore, the integration of specialized simulation software to test the cane handle under a load of 150 N ensures that the design can withstand a certain amount of weight and  both robust and reliable. This precise approach opens up opportunities for further innovations in assistive devices, creating a pathway for more personalized and ergonomically refined mobility support. As a result, we can expect an increase in the adoption of these improved devices, leading to better health outcomes and greater independence for the elderly, leading to a better quality of life. 

  Moreover, the research and testing gained from this development process can help inspire the creation of other mobility technologies in other fields. These technological advancements can contribute to a more inclusive society where the elderly can maintain their mobility and autonomy.</p>

  <p>Due to the high demand for intensive care for elderly people, a new Internet of Things (IoT) prototype has been developed that locates an Alzheimer’s status in real-time and schedules their medication through an alarm system. It features a small GPS and a wireless modem. The patient follows up through the application on computers allows for monitoring of the patient’s medication schedule and daily activities. 

    As Alzheimer's patients struggle to remember things, the design enables monitoring of a patient’s course of medication, making it easier for caregivers to provide the necessary assistance. It has also, been tested for its efficiency and performance. However, it may take time for elderly people to adjust to wearing sensors to monitor everywhere they go. While in the long term this may reduce healthcare costs, in the short term, the costs may be high. The opportunities from this mobility technology are significant. By integrating reliable tracking and medication scheduling, caregivers stick to treatment plans more concisely and respond quickly to any sudden emergencies. This technology can also promote greater independence for patients suffering from Alzheimer's, whilst reducing the pressure on healthcare systems. Additionally, the data collected can be used for research and improve techniques and develop more specialised treatment, for continued innovation in elderly medical field. </p>
